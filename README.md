## How this project is built:

- I did not use any exisiting library like react-bracket.
- Everything was created from stratch using React. I created several reusable component, starting from each team, to different rounds, to the whole bracket.
- I wrote scripts to extract team names and their seed numbers, but was unable to automate the process of finding all the team logos.
- Did some styling to make it look good but don't have the time to make it as good as the official march madness website.
- Since I am a huge ILLINOIS fan, special tricks is applied when you select Illinois as the final winner.
- Can screenshot and make a bracket prdiction.
